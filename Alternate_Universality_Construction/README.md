# Alternate_Universality_Construction
This is a project that implements Problem 4.3 in Quantum Computation and Quantum Information by Nielsen and Chuang. (See "Problem 4.3 N&C.png" for the math background)

The method in Problem 4.3 provides a systematic way to output a quantum circuit from any unitary matrix.

I used this method to solve 2020 IBM-Challenge-4 and got a cost of 239.

See "Github Project–Alternative Universality Construction.ipynb" to see the jupyter notebook implementation

See "cost=359.png" for an unordered quantum circuit with a cost of 359 after transpilation

See "cost=239.png" for an reordered quantum circuit with a cost of 239 after transpilation
