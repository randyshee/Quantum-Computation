# Alternate_Universality_Construction
This is a project that implements Problem 4.3 in Quantum Computation and Quantum Information by Nielsen and Chuang. (See "Problem 4.3 N&C.png" for the math background) The method in Problem 4.3 provides a systematic way to output a quantum circuit from any unitary matrix. And I used this method to solve 2020 IBM-Challenge-4 and got a cost of 239.


See "Github Projectâ€“Alternative Universality Construction.ipynb" for the jupyter notebook implementation

See "cost=359.png" for an unordered quantum circuit with a cost of 359 after transpilation
